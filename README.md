## How to use the linuxtips.sh script

1. Copy the `linuxtips.sh` script and the tips directory where the tip files are stored to your home directory.
2. Open the `~/.bashrc` file using a text editor.
3. Add the following line to the end of the file: `~/linuxtips.sh`
4. Save the changes and exit the editor.
5. Open a new terminal session to run the script.

The `linuxtips.sh` script displays a daily tip in the terminal. To use the script, you need to add it to your `.bashrc` file so that it runs every time you start a new terminal session. This way, you will see a new tip every time you open the terminal. 

Note that if you change the location of the `linuxtips.sh` script or the directory where the tip files are stored, you will need to update the script accordingly.

Converting the line endings of the files from CRLF to LF might be needed for the scripts to work!!
